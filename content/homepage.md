<h1 class="tc">Summer Institute: Digital Humanities for Hellenic Studies - Visualizing the Past: Mapping Athens’ Lost Neighborhood</h1>

<h3 class="tc">July 7-11, 2025</h3>

This workshop is designed for scholars interested in exploring digital humanities methods for mapping and spatial visualization. Mapping in the digital humanities provides new perspectives on sources, enables spatial analysis, and offers visual representations of arguments and narratives. Participants will be introduced to key topics, including spatial data collection, geocoding, georeferencing, data wrangling, different types of maps, mapping and visualization platforms, and hosting. 

Instructors will include scholars from Princeton’s Center for Digital Humanities (CDH), Princeton University Library, the Visual Resources Department of Art and Archaeology, and the MSc Program in Digital Methods for the Humanities at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).
